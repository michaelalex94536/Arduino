##  Arduino projects (mostly)

####  Never was much of an Arduino fan, but it is the fastest way to go if you want to play with a new sensor.  (Once I get familiar with the sensor, I'll move the project to something like an STM32 microcontroller.)  

####  Projects include using the BNO055 9-axis Adafruit board.
